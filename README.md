# Cotton_CUPA-CURE_UnknownGenes

Cotton suffers from a mostly functionally unannotated proteome. This problem is unsolvable by our current automated annotation tools. We systematically identified all unannotated proteins and their corresponding genes and filtered out those that were not appropriate for downstream analysis. We devised one mutually beneficial solution, which involves manual annotation relying on undergraduate students presented in a course-based format (an effort entitled the Cotton Unknown Protein Analysis Course Based Undergraduate Research Experience or CUPA-CURE). This approach ultimately provides valuable annotations, in the form of a microPublication, that would otherwise remain synthesized. 

This repository contains code for analyzing the unknown proteins and workbooks for delivering the CUPA-CURE.
